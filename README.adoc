= IntelliJ HTTP Client CLI GitHub Action

This is a thin GitHub Action wrapper around the https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2022/12/http-client-cli-run-requests-and-tests-on-ci[IntelliJ HTTP Client CLI].
It allows you to run `*.http` files in your GitHub Actions workflows.

== Usage

The action accepts the same inputs as the original CLI tool.
Refer to it's documentation for more details.
A simple way to get that documentation is to run the tool with Docker: `docker run --rm -it jetbrains/intellij-http-client:latest`.

Generally, the action is used like this üëá

[source, yaml]
----
jobs:
  job:
    steps:

      - name: Execute HTTP requests
        uses: madhead/intellij-http-client-action@latest
        with:
          files: |-
            request1.http
            request2.http
          env_file: environments.json
          env: test
          env_variables: |-
            var1=value1
            var2=value2
          insecure: true
----

String and boolean values, like `--env` and `--insecure`, are passed as usually.

List values, like `--files` or `--env-variables`, are passed as https://yaml-multiline.info[YAML multiline strings] ‚ö†Ô∏è
